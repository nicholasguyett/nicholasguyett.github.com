For this project, I created a custom framework and utilized jquery-ui's drag
and drop library.  In the Fashion Design school, users start by selecting the
one of the dolls to use as a base, and then can drag different cloths and
accessories onto the dolls.  Some items have customizable sub options which
automatically popup when the selected.
